        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p> <em> This is my introduction.</em></p>
        <p> I am Ashlay. I am writing to express my sincere gratitude to you for giving me this opportunity to introduce myself to you through this introductory email. I am genuinely thankful for your guidance and for the knowledge I am about to gain in your class.I have completed my higher school education in my home country, India.</p>

        <p>I have completed my higher school education in my home country, India. This is my 1<sup>st</sup> time 
            studying in college. Everything is very new to me. I have chosen the Interactive Media Design course
            because it combines skills like photography, web designing, and graphic designing, which looks
            fascinating to me due to my interest in the technical field. I am very excited to learn many new
            things in further classes to develop myself further.</p></article>
