        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p> <em> This is my introduction.</em></p>
        <p> I am Ashlay. I am writing to express my sincere gratitude to you for giving me this opportunity<br>
            to introduce myself to you through this introductory email. I am genuinely thankful for your<br>
            guidance and for the knowledge I am about to gain in your class.I have completed my higher school<br>
            education in my home country, India.</p>

        <p>I have completed my higher school education in my home country, India. This is my first time <br>
            studying in college. Everything is very new to me. I have chosen the Interactive Media Design course<br>
            because it combines skills like photography, web designing, and graphic designing, which looks<br>
            fascinating to me due to my interest in the technical field. I am very excited to learn many new<br>
            things in further classes to develop myself further.</p></article>
